# ICS3U1 Java Projects 
All my Java Assignments (including Independent Study Unit) in ICS 3U1. A lot of solutions to the assignments use more complicated methods than required, this is to reduce code and experiment with cool things in Java.

The file naming scheme was changed from `assignmentEighteenAnwar` to `anwarAssignment18` (for all files except Summative).

# Code Review:
- [ ] Comments for every line/section (not required for Swing GUI)
- [ ] Consants in CAPITAL_CASE
  - [ ] `final` declared for constants
  - [ ] Constants declared at top/beginning of code
- [ ] Decimal formatting: two decimal places
- [ ] Assignment 22 Onwards: Try-Catch anything with validation, use Spinners in GUI for numbers
