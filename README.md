# ICS3U1 Java Projects 
All my Java Assignments (including Independent Study Unit) in ICS 3U1. A lot of solutions to the assignments use more complicated methods than required, this is to reduce code and experiment with cool things in Java.

The file naming scheme was changed from `assignmentEighteenAnwar` to `anwarAssignment18` (for all files except Summative).

# Code Review:
- [ ] Comments for every line/section (not required for Swing GUI)
- [ ] Consants in CAPITAL_CASE
  - [ ] `final` declared for constants
  - [ ] Constants declared at top/beginning of code
- [ ] Decimal formatting: two decimal places
- [ ] Assignment 22 Onwards: Try-Catch anything with validation
  - [ ] Preferably use Spinners for numbers (especially in ISU) but that is generally not allowed

NOTE: Assignments 2, 5 and 6 have small mistakes in them.
Assignment 2
- [ ] Rate of interest and principle should be double, to stop program from crashing

Assignment 5
- [ ] Constants need to be in all caps

Assignment 6
- [ ] Discount limits and percentages need to be constants
- [ ] Discount ad 90.01 and 50.01 are incorrect
- [ ] Inputs shouldn't be constants (highly disputable, in my opinion)
