# javaProjects 
All of my Java Assignments (and ISU) in ICS 3U1. A lot of solutions to the assignments use more complicated methods than required, this is to reduce code and experiment with cool things in Java.

The file naming scheme has every assignment number written in words, in hindsight it may have been better to use numbers.
