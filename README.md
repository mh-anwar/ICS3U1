# javaProjects 
All of my Java Assignments (and ISU) in ICS 3U1. A lot of solutions to the assignments use more complicated methods than required, this is to reduce code and experiment with cool things in Java.

The file naming scheme was changed from `assignmentEighteenAnwar` to `anwarAssignment18` (for all files except Summative).
